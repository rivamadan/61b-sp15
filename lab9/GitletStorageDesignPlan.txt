Basic Storage Design Plan for Gitlet


Overview
-------
- .gitlet/toAddFiles.ser: contains a list of the current added files
- .gitlet/commits/allCommits.ser: contains a tree of the commits
- .gitlet/commits/XXX/: contains copies of the added files in commit XXX
- .gitlet/commits/XXX/: addedFiles.ser: contains a map of all files in the commit and the most previous commit it was added in


Sequential Example
-------

For each of the commands below, describe in detail what files on your computer change after the command is executed. Only list changes made to files. Do not list details regarding the reading of files.

$ java Gitlet init

 - If it does not already exist, a new folder called .gitlet is created in the current directory.
 - create allCommits.ser with commit 0

$ java Gitlet add dog.txt

- create new toAddFiles.ser with dog.txt

$ java Gitlet commit “initial commit of dog.txt”

- overwrite allCommits.ser with an updated version with current commit 1 added
- overwrite toAddFiles.ser with an empty version
- create directory .gitlet/commits/1 with a copy of dog.txt
- create .gitlet/commits/1/addedFiles.ser with dog.txt associated with commit 1

$ java Gitlet add dog.txt

- dog.txt has not been modified since last commit, so files don't change

$ cp manyDogs.txt dog.txt
$ java Gitlet add dog.txt

- overwrite toAddFiles.ser with an updated version with dog.txt added

$ java Gitlet commit “replaced dog.txt with manyDogs”

- overwrite allCommits.ser with an updated version with current commit 2 added
- overwrite toAddFiles.ser with an empty version
- create directory .gitlet/commits/2 with a copy of dog.txt
- create .gitlet/commits/2/addedFiles.ser with the contents of commit 1, but updated with dog.txt associated with commit 2

$ java Gitlet add manyDogs.txt

-overwrite toAddFiles.ser with an updated version with manyDogs.txt added

$ java Gitlet add ketchupFriend.txt

-overwrite toAddFiles.ser with an updated version with ketchupFriend.txt added

$ java Gitlet commit “added manyDogs and ketchupFriend”

- overwrite allCommits.ser with an updated version with current commit 3 added
- overwrite toAddFiles.ser with an empty version
- create directory .gitlet/commits/3 with a copy of manyDogs.txt and ketchupFriend.txt
- create .gitlet/commits/3/addedFiles.ser with the contents of commit 2's, but updated with manyDogs.txt and ketchupFriend associated with commit 3

$ java Gitlet commit YOLO

- no changes added to commit, so files don't change

$ cp doge.txt manyDogs.txt
$ java Gitlet add manyDogs.txt

-overwrite toAddFiles.ser with an updated version with manyDogs.txt added

$ java Gitlet commit “replaced manyDogs with doge”

- overwrite allCommits.ser with an updated version with current commit 4 added
- overwrite toAddFiles.ser with an empty version
- create directory .gitlet/commits/4 with a copy of manyDogs.txt
- create .gitlet/commits/3/addedFiles.ser with the contents of commit 3's, but updated with manyDogs.txt associated with commit 4

$ java Gitlet add dog.txt

- dog.txt has not been modified since last commit, so files don't change

$ java Gitlet commit “added dog yet again”

- no changes added to commit, so files don't change
